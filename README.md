# Advanced Programming Languages Assignment

## Overview
This repository contains code and analysis for an advanced programming languages course (Master's level). The assignment is divided into two parts:

- **Part 1:** Syntax and Semantics  
  Introduces intentional syntax errors in Python, JavaScript, and C++ programs that calculate the sum of an array. The errors demonstrate how different languages handle syntax mistakes and their corresponding error messages.

- **Part 2:** Memory Management  
  Contains small programs in Rust, Java, and C++ illustrating different approaches to dynamic memory management: ownership and borrowing in Rust, garbage collection in Java, and manual memory management in C++. The goal is to compare memory management strategies and analyze potential issues like memory leaks and dangling pointers.

## How to Run

### Part 1
- Run Python file with Python 3 interpreter:
  ```bash
  python3 part1/python_syntax_error.py
Run JavaScript file with Node.js:
node javascript_syntax_error.js
Compile and run C++ file with g++:
g++ cpp_syntax_error.cpp -o cpp_syntax_error
./cpp_syntax_error

Part 2
Rust (requires Rust toolchain):
rustc rust_memory_management.rs
./rust_memory_management
Java:
javac JavaMemoryManagement.java
java JavaMemoryManagement
C++:
g++ cpp_memory_management.cpp -o cpp_memory_management
./cpp_memory_management
